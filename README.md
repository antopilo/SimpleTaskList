# SimpleTaskList
This is a simple app that keeps track of your tasks. It was developped for my own use. I needed something simple and efficient without all the bloat-ware that others would give me. It is meant to be light-weight and fast.

## Usage
SimpleTaskList can manage multiple list at once with any problem. It can be used for pretty much anything. All list are saved into an .XML file that contains all the tasks in the list.

## Installation
Simply download the compiled version here and place it somewhere safe in a folder. Make a shortcut somewhere useful on your pc. It is important to place the .exe in its own folder as it is where all your tasks will be saved.

## Note
This was developped for personal use and I'm sharing it here for someone who might find it useful also. It is meant to replace the normal notepad task list that I used to do while programming. again, simple and efficient.
